      <description>EncodingComputer can store data only with 0s and 1s. Putting together a lot of 0s and 1s, a computer can present a bigger number. But if it want to store a letter, it needs a mapping of a number onto a letter. This mapping is called “encoding”.
Encoding depends on the letters to store. Letters people use are different for different countries and languages. There are over 1000 encodings worldwide.</description>
